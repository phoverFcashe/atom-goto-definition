## What is a JAR File?
 
A JAR file is a Java Archive file that contains Java classes and resources that can be executed on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). A JAR file can be used to distribute applications or libraries that run on Java platforms. A JAR file can also be compressed to reduce its size and improve its performance.
 
## Why Do You Need WhatsApp 1.3.0 JAR File for Java Phones?
