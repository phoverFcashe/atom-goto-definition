In this article, I will share my personal review of Finding Dory, as well as some of the opinions of other critics and audiences. I hope this will help you decide whether to watch this movie or not.
 
First of all, I have to say that I loved Finding Nemo, and I was very excited to see Finding Dory. I was expecting a lot from this sequel, and I was not disappointed. Finding Dory is a beautiful, funny and touching movie that made me laugh and cry. It also has some important messages about family, friendship, identity and overcoming challenges.
 
The animation is stunning, as usual for Pixar. The underwater world is richly detailed and colorful, and the characters are expressive and realistic. The voice acting is also superb, especially Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. She brings so much charm and emotion to her role, and makes us care for her character. Albert Brooks is also great as Marlin, the overprotective father who learns to let go. The new characters are also memorable and likable, such as Hank the octopus, Destiny the whale shark and Bailey the beluga whale.
 
The story is simple but engaging. It follows Dory's quest to find her parents, who she lost when she was a baby. Along the way, she meets new friends and faces new dangers. She also learns more about herself and her past. The movie has a good balance of humor and drama, and it never feels boring or repetitive. The movie also has some surprises and twists that keep us interested.
 
However, Finding Dory is not perfect. Some critics have pointed out that the movie is too similar to Finding Nemo, and that it lacks originality. They also argue that the movie relies too much on coincidences and unrealistic scenarios, such as fish driving a truck or escaping from a tank. Some audiences have also complained that the movie is too sentimental or preachy, and that it tries too hard to make us cry or feel good.
 
Personally, I disagree with these criticisms. I think Finding Dory is a worthy sequel that expands on the themes and characters of Finding Nemo. I think the movie is creative and clever, and that it uses humor and fantasy to make us enjoy the adventure. I also think the movie is sincere and heartfelt, and that it does not manipulate our emotions or force us to accept its messages.
 
In conclusion, I think Finding Dory is a wonderful movie that deserves to be seen by everyone. It is a movie that celebrates life, love and hope. It is a movie that reminds us to never give up on our dreams or ourselves. It is a movie that makes us happy.
