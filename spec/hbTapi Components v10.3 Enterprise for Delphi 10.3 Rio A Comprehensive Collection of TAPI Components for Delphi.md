The first step is to install hbTapi Components on your computer. You can download the installer from their website and follow the instructions to complete the installation. After that, you will find hbTapi Components in the component palette of Delphi under the hbTapi category.
 
The next step is to create a new VCL application in Delphi and add some components from hbTapi Components to the main form. We will need the following components:
 
- ThbLine: This component represents a telephony line device that can be used to make and receive calls.
- ThbLineMonitor: This component monitors the events and states of a line device.
- ThbCall: This component represents a call on a line device.
- ThbCallMonitor: This component monitors the events and states of a call.
- ThbWavePlayer: This component plays a wave file to a call.

We will also need some standard VCL components to display and interact with the user interface:

- TLabel: This component displays text on the form.
- TEdit: This component allows the user to enter text on the form.
- TButton: This component allows the user to perform an action by clicking on it.

The following screenshot shows how we arranged the components on the form:
