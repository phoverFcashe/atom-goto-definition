Bartender Ultralite is a software that designs and prints high-quality labels for various purposes. It is compatible with many printers, including Zebra ZD230. However, if you are using an older version of Bartender Ultralite, such as 9.3 SR2 174, you may want to upgrade to a newer version to enjoy more features and benefits.
 
One of the challenges of upgrading from Bartender Ultralite 9.3 SR2 174 is migrating the license server and the client installations to a different server. The license server application is no longer used in newer versions of Bartender Ultralite, and the license is now part of the Administration Console application.
